Learning outcomes:
- First React app! This project helped familiarize me with React folder structure conventions, React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef, as well as adopting a component-based mindset when creating a webpage
- Practice with CSS grid and transitions
- Practice with using axios to make asyncronous requests to external APIs
